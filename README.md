# Counting Tasks by Turac
The **Counting Tasks** script allows you to create tasks on [Habitica](https://habitica.com/) with counters in them.

Every time you score the task, the counter is either increased or decreased. This way you may track how often you have done a task or configure tasks with a limited number of executions (e.g. using the credit on a 10-session membership card).

## Features
